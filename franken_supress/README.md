Similar to franken, but varying the weight of the supress revisit

Things we're going for

* Sometimes swapping y out for u so there can be more z-band DDF observations
* Have COSMOS with two very deep seasons, starting earlier than before
* 4 rolling seasons, but first year still uniform. Flipping the order of the rolling bands for trojans
* fix small rolling scale bug
* fix the twilight NEO survey
* vary the weight on supress revisits

The franken_supress_fp runs should be the same, but include some fiddles to footprint filter balances.
