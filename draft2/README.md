Keep neo twilight survey working at neo_brightest_repeat4_riz_np4
keep flipping u/z/y
flip rolling cadence
add extra year of rolling cadence toward end of survey
flip default strength of rolling cadence to 0.9
Try to get DDF fields running at 6.5% with COSMOS going deep early (by year 3)
repeat revisits at -20 in blobs
change footprint so gp is down by 0.9-0.95
about same filter balance as light_roll
