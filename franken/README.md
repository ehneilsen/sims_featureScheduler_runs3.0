A combination of things learned and bugs fixed to try and get to a working 3.0

Things we're going for

* Sometimes swapping y out for u so there can be more z-band DDF observations
* Have COSMOS with two very deep seasons, starting earlier than before
* 4 rolling seasons, but first year still uniform. Flipping the order of the rolling bands for trojans
* fix small rolling scale bug
* fix the twilight NEO survey


Other potential changes:
* fiddle with the supress repeat weight?
* more DDF fiddles for overall time?
* turn down bulge and plane slightly?
* balance the twilight NEO filters a bit?
