Runs that are drafts for the eventual 3.0 release


About the run here:
current footprint,  with galactic diamond replaced with agg_level_1.5 (as in the setup in the galplane directory of 2.2)
current filter balance, but with galactic plane having redder filter balance (as in the galplane directory of 2.2)
2 band 0.9 strength rolling cadence
suppress revisits and long gap triplets (as in the suppress
NEO microsurvey (as in the repeat4_riz_np4 I think -- of 4 repeat visits per pointing in riz filters with a 1 night on / 3 nights off cadence, which I believe matches repeat4_riz_np4)
DDF like the ddf_custom  --- but note, the total fraction of visits in the DDF fields in ddf_custom was 10%, so this needs some adjustment to bring it down to more like 7%.
ToO .. yeah, I don't know. Maybe leave these for now, or alternatively just add a low rate of ToOs with 5 filters, 1/2/4 hr passes (and not the following night).
