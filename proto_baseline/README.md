Baseline simulation


Noteable changes since v2.2

* Shifted start date to June 1, 2024
* Adjusted bulge and dusty plane footprint (still want further refinement, but hopefully getting closer)
* DDF adjustments including having COSMOS get very deep after only 3 years
* Added an additional season of rolling (to the end of the survey) 
* Flipped the order the rolling stripes execure (seems to help some solar system objects, may want to flip back depending on actual survey start date?)
